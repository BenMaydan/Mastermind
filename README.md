# Basic Idea
### The computer creates a color code that is 4 colors long
### You need to try and guess the code in at max 10 moves
### The computer has two different colored pegs to explain to you how your guess was wrong/right


# White/Black Peg Hints
### A black peg placed on the far right of the board means that one color in your code is the correct color and the correct position
### A white peg placed on the far right of the board means that one color in your code is the correct color, but the incorrect position


# Rules
### You can reuse the same color up to 4 times in the code that you submit for guessing
### Every code you submit for guessing needs to have four colors in it (for example, you cannot submit a code with only one red peg in the beginning)
